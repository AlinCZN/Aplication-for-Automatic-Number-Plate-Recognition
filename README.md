License plate detection involves identifying and extracting information from vehicle license plates in images or videos. This process relies on advanced image processing techniques and optical sensors to capture visual data. Key steps include image preprocessing (such as grayscale conversion and smoothing filters), edge and contour detection, and locating potential license plate regions. Finally, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used to read and extract the plate's text. These techniques enable accurate and efficient license plate recognition for various applications, including security and traffic monitoring.
